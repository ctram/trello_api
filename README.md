Project: Boards APIs.

You have to implement using the following technologies:

- API - any backend framework similar to RoR
  (You are free to choose any version you want)

The goal of the project is to implement the APIs for a product similar to trello.

- boards APIs - CRUD operations (each board has a name / title)
- columns APIs - CRUD operations (each column belongs to a board and will have a name / title)
- tasks APIs - CRUD operations (each task belongs to a column and will have a name / title)
- comments APIs - CRUD operations (each comment belongs to a task and will have a content)
- data should be persisted in a DB

Should implement a sort order for columns and tasks to allow reordering of items from an application that will use this API (order must be persisted in the DB)
Please add also auth mechanism (all API actions can be performed ONLY after checking call is authorized).

Once it's ready please give us the link to the github repo. (Github repo should have a readme in which you explain how to install / run everything locally)
We will analyze the code quality / patterns used / validations / unit tests / etc.

In case you have any questions, please let me know.
Thanks!
